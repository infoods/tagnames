<PROA>    protein, total; determined by direct
          analysis
     Unit: g

<PROANI> protein from animal sources
     Unit: g

<PROCNA>
     protein, total; calculated from amino
     nitrogen
     Unit: g
      Comments: Two pieces of data are associated
          with the tagname <PROCNA>.  The first is
          the quantity of total protein and the
          second is the conversion factor used to
          calculate total protein from amino
          nitrogen.
      Note: The total protein found in food
          tables is rarely calculated from amino
          nitrogen.  <PROCNT> is the appropriate
          tagname for total protein in most cases.

<PROCNP>
     protein, total; calculated from protein
     nitrogen
     Unit: g
      Comments: Two pieces of data are associated
          with the tagname <PROCNP>.  The first is
          the quantity of total protein and the
          second is the conversion factor used to
          calculate total protein from protein
          nitrogen.
      Note: The total protein found in food
          tables is rarely calculated from protein
          nitrogen. <PROCNT> is the appropriate
          tagname for total protein in most cases.

<PROCNT>
     protein, total; calculated from total
     nitrogen
     Unit: g
      Comments: Three pieces of data are
          associated with the tagname <PROCNT>.  The
          first is the quantity of total protein;
          the second is a keyword which identifies
          the source of the conversion factor used
          to calculate the total protein from total
          nitrogen; and the third is the actual
          conversion factor used.  If possible, all
          three pieces of data should be included
          with <PROCNT>.  However, it is acceptable
          to include only the keyword or the
          conversion factor (rather than both) with
          the total protein value if one or the
          other is unknown.  If the conversion
          factor used was generated from a source
          other than one of those identified by the
          available keywords, the conversion factor
          should be listed without any keyword
          information.
      Keywords: Following are the available
          keywords that can be used as the
          second value for the <PROCNT>
          tagname:
     JONES  conversion factor originally
     derived by Jones (?)
     Tables: EGP, NE, EA
      FAO  conversion factor from a table in
          the FAO Nutritional Studies No. 24
          (?), reprinted in the World Health
          Organization Technical Report Series
          No. 522 (?)
     Tables: MW, DAN
      USDA  conversion factor from a table
          in the United States Department of
          Agriculture Handbook No. 8 (?)
     Tables: USDA 203
      STD  standard conversion factor of
          6.25, not specific for the type of
          food.  (If this keyword is used, the
          6.25 conversion factor should not be
          listed with the secondary tagname
          <XN>.)
     Tables: SFK, IND, PRC

      The following secondary tagname may be
          used to identify the specific
          conversion factor used when a keyword
          other than STD is present, or instead
          of a keyword (see above).
      <XN>  conversion factor for
          calculating total protein from total
          nitrogen
      Examples: The 3.2 g/100 g of protein
          in cow's milk which is listed in the
          Nutritive Value of Indian Foods was
          calculated from total nitrogen using
          the 6.25 conversion factor. 
          Therefore, the protein value would be
          listed using the <PROCNT> tagname and
          the STD keyword:
               <PROCNT> 3.2 STD </PROCNT>

          The 3.3 g/100 g of protein in cow's milk
          which is listed in McCance and Widdowson
          was calculated from total nitrogen using a
          6.38 conversion factor.  This factor was
          obtained from the FAO publication. 
          Therefore, the protein value would be
          listed using the <PROCNT> tagname, the FAO
          keyword, and the <XN> secondary tagname:
               <PROCNT> 3.3 FAO <XN> 6.38 </PROCNT>

          As a hypothetical example, if a value of
          0.3 g/100 g of protein in watermelon seeds
          were calculated from total nitrogen using
          the conversion factor 5.30, and this value
          had not been taken from one of the tables
          identified by the list of keywords, the
          protein value would be listed using the
          <PROCNT> tagname in the following manner:
               <PROCNT> 0.3 <XN> 5.30 </PROCNT>
      Note: In these examples, </PROCNT> is an
          end-tag required in interchange format to
          indicate the end of the information about
          protein calculated from total nitrogen. 
          See the INFOODS Data Interchange Handbook
          for details on interchange format.

<PRO->
     protein, total; method of determination
     unknown or variable
     Unit: g
      Comments: The <PRO-> tagname should be used
          for a total protein value when it is not
          known whether the value was the result of
          a direct analysis or whether it was
          calculated from total nitrogen, protein
          nitrogen, or amino nitrogen.  The <PRO->
          tagname should also be used if it is known
          that the total protein value was
          calculated from one of the nitrogen
          components, but the conversion factor used
          in the calculation is unknown.

      Unit: mcg.  The value for <VITA> may
          be expressed in international units
          instead of the default unit of
          micrograms.  International units are
          not preferred; however, if they are
          used, IU must be explicitly stated
          with the secondary tagname <UNIT/>.
      Note: It would be confusing and would
          imply additional information that
          does not exist if two <VITA> values,
          i.e., one expressed in mcg and the
          other expressed in IU, were included
          for a single food item when one value
          has simply been calculated from the
          other using the following conversion
          equation:  1 retinol equivalent =
          3.33 IU vitamin A activity from
          retinol = 10 IU vitamin A activity
          from beta-carotene.  Consequently,
          one or the other should be used, but
          not both.

          used if it is not known whether the
          vitamin D value was determined by bioassay
          or by calculation.  

<VITE>
      vitamin E; calculated by summation of the
          vitamin E activities of the active
          tocopherols and tocotrienols; expressed as
          alpha-tocopherol equivalents
      Unit: mg.  The value for <VITE> may be
          expressed in international units instead
          of the default unit of milligrams. 
          International units are not preferred;
          however, if they are used, IU must be
          explicitly stated with the secondary
          tagname <UNIT/>.
      Note: It would be confusing and would imply
          additional information that does not exist
          if two <VITE> values, i.e., one expressed
          in mg and the other expressed in IU, were
          included for a single food item when one
          value has simply been calculated from the
          other using the conversion equation: 1 mg
          alpha-tocopherol equivalents = 1.49 IU. 
          Consequently, one or the other should be
          used, but not both.
      Comments: In addition to a value for the
          quantity of vitamin E expressed as alpha-
          tocopherol equivalents, <VITE> includes a
          description or listing of the conversion
          factors used to calculate this
          vitamin E value from the active
          tocopherols and tocotrienols.  The
          conversion factors may be described
          by a keyword or may be listed using
          secondary tagnames within <VITE>. 
          (More than one <VITE> tagname may
          exist for a single food item if the
          values were calculated from the
          active tocopherols and tocotrienols
          using different conversion factors.)
      Keywords: The available keywords for
          describing the conversion factors
          used for calculating vitamin E in
          alpha-tocopherol equivalents are
          listed below:
      USDA  United States Department of
          Agriculture conversion factors as
          reported by McLaughlin & Weihrauch
          (?)
               alpha-tocopherol = 1.00
               beta-tocopherol = 0.40
               gamma-tocopherol = 0.10
               delta-tocopherol = 0.01
               alpha-tocotrienol = 0.30
               beta-tocotrienol = 0.05
               gamma-tocotrienol = 0.01
     Tables: USDA 340
      MW  conversion factors cited by
          McCance and Widdowson (?), pages 13
          and 14.  These values are not used in
          the vitamin E values in that table.
               alpha-tocopherol = 1.00
               beta-tocopherol = 0.30
               gamma-tocopherol = 0.15
               alpha-tocotrienol = 0.30
     Tables: MW
      RDA  conversion factors reported in
          the ninth edition of the Recommended
          Dietary Allowances for the United
          States (?)
               alpha-tocopherol = 1.00
               beta-tocopherol = 0.50
               gamma-tocopherol = 0.10
               alpha-tocotrienol = 0.30

      If none of the above keywords apply, the
          actual conversion factors used to
          calculate vitamin E should be listed using
          the following secondary tagnames:
          <XATP> alpha-tocopherol conversion factor
          <XBTP> beta-tocopherol conversion factor
          <XGTP> gamma-tocopherol conversion factor
          <XDTP> delta-tocopherol conversion factor
          <XATT> alpha-tocotrienol conversion factor
          <XBTT> beta-tocotrienol conversion factor
          <XGTT> gamma-tocotrienol conversion factor
      Examples: The 0.10 mg/100 g vitamin E value
          for fresh, whole cow's milk in the McCance
          and Widdowson food table represents alpha-
          tocopherol only.  Consequently, the value
          0.10 would be shown with the <TOCPHA>
          tagname, not the <VITE> tagname and the
          associated keyword:
               <TOCPHA> 0.10 </TOCPHA>

          If a vitamin E value of 0.12, expressed in
          alpha-tocopherol equivalents, were
          calculated for whole cow's milk from the
          alpha-tocopherol, beta-tocopherol, gamma-
          tocopherol, and alpha-tocotrienol values,
          and the conversion factors used did not
          conform to any of the factors described by
          the available keywords, the vitamin E
          value would be listed using the <VITE>
          tagname and the <XBTP>, <XGTP>, and <XATT>
          secondary tagnames:
               <VITE> 0.12 <XBTP> 0.4 <XGTP> 0.1 <XATT>
               0.25 </VITE>
      Note: In these examples, </VITE> and
          </TOCPHA> are end-tags required in
          interchange format to indicate the end of
          the vitamin E information.  See the
          INFOODS Data Interchange Handbook for
          details on interchange format.

<VITEA>
     vitamin E; determined by bioassay
     Unit: IU
     Comments: Rarely used, not in major tables.

<VITE->vitamin E, method of determination
               unknown or variable; expressed as alpha-
               tocopherol equivalents.
      Unit: mg.  The value for <VITE-> may
          be expressed in international units
          instead of the default unit of
          milligrams.  International units are
          not preferred; however, if they are
          used, IU must be explicitly stated
          with the secondary tagname <UNIT/>.
      Comments: The <VITE-> tagname should
          be used if it is not known whether
          the vitamin E value was determined by
          bioassay or by calculation.  It
          should also be used if it is known
          that the vitamin E value was
          determined by calculation but the
          conversion factors used in the
          calculation are not known.

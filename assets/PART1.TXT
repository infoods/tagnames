<AAA>     amino acids, total aromatic
      Unit:  mg
      Comments: The total value is the sum of
          phenylalanine plus tyrosine only, in spite
          of the fact that tryptophan is also
          chemically aromatic.
      Tables: USDA 523, EA, SWD

<AAE8>
      amino acids, total essential; includes the
          eight basic essential amino acids:

          amino acids because they are essential for
          infants.

<AAE10B>amino acids, total essential; includes
               the eight basic essential amino acids
               plus cystine and tyrosine
      Unit: mg
      Comments: Cystine and tyrosine are
          included in this definition of
          essential amino acids because of
          their sparing effects on the
          requirements for methionine and
          phenylalanine respectively.

      Unit: mg
      Comments: Arginine and histidine are
          included in this definition of
          essential amino acids because they
          are essential for infants.  Cystine
          and tyrosine are included because of

      Comments: When total amino acids are
          reported, they are usually the sum of
          whatever amino acids were analysed for
          that particular food.  Consequently, this
          term is not precisely defined.  Additional
          tagnames will be introduced when precise

      Keywords: Following are the available
          keywords to describe the conversion
          factors that were used for calculating
          total metabolizable energy:\n

          food as reported in World Health
          Organization Technical Report Series No.
          522 (?) and the United States Department
          of Agriculture Handbooks No. 8 (?) and No.
          74 (?).\n
          Note# The following two codes, RUBA
          and RUBT, represent conversion
          factors that were used primarily for
          calculating the energy data in early
          editions of McCance and Widdowson. 
          It is believed that the Rubner
          conversion factors are no longer in
          active use.\n
      RUBA  Rubner conversion factors using
          available carbohydrate\n
          kilocalories = (4.1 x g total
          protein) + (3.75 x g available
          carbohydrate expressed as
          monosaccharides) + (9.3 x g total
          fat) + (7 x g alcohol)\n
      RUBT  Rubner conversion factors using
          total carbohydrate\n
          kilocalories = (4.1 x g total
          protein) + (4.1 x g total
          carbohydrate) + (9.3 x g total fat) +
          (7 x g alcohol)

      If none of the above keywords apply,
          the actual conversion factors used to
          calculate the total metabolizable
          energy should be listed using the
          following secondary tagnames:\n
      <XP>  conversion factor for
          calculating energy from protein\n
      <XCT>  conversion factor for
          calculating energy from total
          carbohydrate\n
      <XCA>  conversion factor for
          calculating energy from available
          carbohydrate\n
      <XF>  conversion factor for
          calculating energy from fat\n
      <XA>  conversion factor for
          calculating energy from alcohol\n
      <XO>  conversion factor for
          calculating energy from organic acid\n
          Note# If these secondary tagnames are
          used, conversion factors for <XP> and
          <XF> are required; a conversion
          factor for either <XCT> or <XCA> is
          required; and conversion factors for
          <XA> and <XO> are optional.

      <ENERC> may not be used without either one
          of the keywords specified above or a set
          of specific conversion factors (or both). 
          If the conversion system and factors are
          unknown, <ENER-> should be used.
      Examples: The 76 kcal/100 g energy value
          for whole cow's milk in the Ethiopian food
          table was calculated from proximate values
          using conversion factors from the USDA
          Agriculture Handbook No. 8.  Therefore,
          the energy value would be listed using the
          <ENERC> tagname and the USDA keyword, with
          the kilocalorie unit stated with the
          secondary tagname <UNIT/> to replace the
          default unit of kilojoules:\n
               <ENERC> 76 USDA <UNIT/> kcal </UNIT/>
               </ENERC>\n
          \n
          The 272 kJ/100 g energy value for fresh,
          whole cow's milk in the McCance and
          Widdowson food table was calculated with
         the kilojoule conversion factors that use
          available carbohydrate.  Therefore, the
          energy value would be listed using the
          <ENERC> tagname and the KJA keyword:\n
               <ENERC> 272 KJA </ENERC>\n
          \n
          If an energy value expressed in
          kilocalories were calculated for whole
          cow's milk using conversion factors for
          protein, fat, and total carbohydrate, and
          these conversion factors did not conform
          to any of the factors described by the
          available keywords, the energy value would
          be listed using the <ENERC> tagname and
          the <XP>, <XF> and <XCT> secondary
          tagnames.  The kilocalorie unit would be
          stated with the secondary tagname <UNIT/>
          to replace the default unit of kilojoules:\n
               <ENERC> 76.42 <XP> 4.3 <XF> 8.8 <XCT> 3.9
               <UNIT/> kcal </UNIT/> </ENERC>\n
          Note# In these examples, </UNIT/> and
          </ENERC> are end-tags required in
          interchange format to indicate the end of
          the unit and energy information.  See the
          INFOODS Data Interchange Handbook for
          details on interchange format.

<ENER->   energy; method of determination
          unknown or variable
      Unit: kJ.  The value for <ENER-> may
          be expressed in kilocalories instead
          of the default unit of kilojoules.
          However, if expressed in
          kilocalories, kcal must be explicitly
          stated with the secondary tagname
          <UNIT/>.\n
          Note# It would be confusing and would
          imply additional information that
          does not exist if two <ENER-> values,
          i.e., one expressed in kilocalories
          and the other expressed in
          kilojoules, were included for a
          single food item when one value has
          simply been calculated from the other
          using the conversion equation: 1 kcal
          = 4.184 kJ.  Consequently, one or the
          other should be used, but not both.
     Synonyms: kilojoules; kilocalories;
     Calories; food energy
      Comments: The <ENER-> tagname should
          be used if it is not known whether
          the energy value represents gross
          energy or total metabolizable energy. 
          It should also be used if it is known
          that the energy value was calculated
          from the proximate components but the
          conversion factors used are unknown. 
          (It is meaningless to have <ENER-> in
          combination with either <ENERA> or
          <ENERC> for a given food item.)
